                    – a circular fingerprint where the maximum size of the fingerprint set is pre-defined by a specified radius. Fingerprints are generated from all 
                    possible paths in a molecule up to the specified radius.

                    – a path-based fingerprint in which the set of fragments from a compound is generated from all possible pairs of non-hydrogen atoms separated by an interatomic distance. The fingerprint description also includes the 
                    nearest neighbors of the two atoms and specifies the presence of π electrons where applicable.

                    – the algorithm begins by a Tanimoto similarity (described below) input by the user. Each compound is then assigned a certain number of neighbors where each neighbor shares at least the inputted similarity level. 
                    All compounds are then ranked by decreasing number of neighbors with the compound having the most neighbors designated as the centroid of the first cluster. All compounds belonging to this first cluster are excluded from being apart of all other clusters. 
                    This process is repeated down the list until the remaining compounds have no neighbors and are thus designated as singletons

                    <b>Tanimoto similarity</b> 
                    – a mathematical measure of similarity between two data sets defined as the number of common features divided by the number of total features within the data sets. Consider two data sets A and B, the Tanimoto similarity can 
                    be calculated using the equation below and lies in the range of 0-1.

                <p>In cheminformatics, the Tanimoto similarity is the most popular similarity measure and is frequently used to compare compounds based on a defined property – such as 2D fingerprints. Our website uses the Tanimoto similarity in conjunction with the 
                    Butina Exclusion Sphere algorithm to cluster compounds based on their 2D fingerprints.</p>
